Feature: content of merged articles

As a shared blogger
So that I can merge articles with similar topics/views
I want to merge the articles in question

Background: articles ready to be merged

Given the following articles exist:
| title | author | body |
| Article A | AuthorA | BodyA |
| Article B | AuthorB | BodyB |
And I am on the edit page for "Article A"
And the current user is admin
When I fill in "Merge Article With" with "2"
And I follow "Merge With This Article"
Then I should be on the view page for "Article A + Article B"
## Not sure how we plan to create a new title for merged articles
Scenario: the text of the articles are in the merged article
When I am on the view page for "Article A + Article B"
Then I should see the text of "Article A"
And I should see the text of "Article B"
Scenario: the authors of the articles are in the merged article
When I am on the content page
Then I should see "AuthorA"
## I don't think we can say 'see the author of "Article B"' because "Article B" has been destroyed
And I should see "AuthorB"
