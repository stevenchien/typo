Feature: permissions of merged articles

As an author of a merged article
So that I can collaborate easily with other authors
I want to be able to make changes to merged articles

Background: merged article exists

Given the following articles exist:
| title | author |
| Article AB | authorA, authorB |

When I am on the content page

Scenario: an author can edit merged article
When the current user is "authorA"
And I follow "Article AB"
Then I should be on the edit page for "Article AB"

Scenario: another author can edit the same merged article
When the current user is "authorB"
And I follow "Article AB"
Then I should be on the edit page for "Article AB"
